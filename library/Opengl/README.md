Used to draw a pyramid presented in three-dimensional space, 
the color is white and can be rotated to generate different effects with 
different lighting
Noteï¼šThe color transformation can be changed by changing 
the image of the texture, and I think I can add a qt button to 
select different textures to show different effects.
 For the tetrahedron , my idea is to design a few more faces (but still Not implemented because there is no time...)

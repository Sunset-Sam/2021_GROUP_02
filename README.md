The project is to develop a large scale software project that is capable of opening and displaying CAD files in STL file format as well as a custom format
The project will require the team to create libraries that will then be linked with a qt program that will display the CAD file
This project is documented using doxygen and the documentation can be found at: https://smithlo02.github.io/2021_GROUP_02/index.html
